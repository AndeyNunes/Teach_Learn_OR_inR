Abstract:
In recent years, the Engineering Technology Management program at Portland State
University has retooled several courses to teach decision science modeling/analytics
and engineering management concepts using R and the Rstudio ecosystem.

Advantages to using R and particularly R Markdown to teach and learn concepts like linear
programming that are mathematically modeled and potentially computationally intensive include:
+ code is (ideally) transparent, reproducible, readable (vs. a typical Excel tool)
+ ability to weave narrative, notes, calculations, and LaTex and produce assignments and reports
+ sharing code, vignettes, data, and examples as teaching/work samples
+  any more? (please edit)

Often students start a class with similar levels of prerequisite knowledge for the course
content, but widely varying levels of experience with programming or markup languages.
One of the challenges students and instructors face is the toggle between learning R
(and RStudio, and R package libraries) and learning (insert the new concept) in R.

Dr. Anderson will share his approach to teaching Operations Research in R using the
textbook he is authoring in Bookdown. Class is focused on conceptual demonstration and
interactive code sessions using R Markdown in RStudio as the platform for learning.
Additionally, a classroom space in rstudio.cloud creates a way to share documents,
assignments, and student projects. While this approach addresses some common barriers
to implementing R and learning Operations Research using R packages, it comes with its
own set of challenges.

Andey is a PSU student with a couple years of grad school experience learning statistics,
systems modeling/simulation and R programming. Inspired by immersive experiential learning
like Dr. Anderson's Operations Research class, he shares learners' perspectives in navigating
challenges and getting through the R learning so you can focus on learning (insert your
new concept here) in R. He hopes sharing this approach, opens a larger conversation
about supporting and improving student coding and conceptual learning experiences.
